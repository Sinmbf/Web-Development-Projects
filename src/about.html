        <h1><b>About Karnataka Eco Tourism</b></h1>
        <p>
          On 15th August, 2013 the Karnataka state cabinet approved the
          proposal to set up the Karnataka eco tourism development board. The
          forest minister of Karnataka would serve as the chairman. The
          initiative would help the government immensely in protecting the
          wildlife, creating awareness about it, encouraging eco-tourism,
          forest safaris and also prevent damage to eco-system in the name of
          tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering that multitude of tourists visiting India and the
          domestic tourists do visit destinations that fall in the categories
          of Eco tourism and nature based tourism; it is pertinent that
          studies in the sector will add value and bring about positive growth
          and development if approached from a 360Â° angle. Karnataka has been
          a forefront of many aspects of tourism promotion and off late there
          has been a qualitative churn and an intensive focus on Eco tourism.
          The creation of the Karnataka Eco Tourism Development Board (KEDB)
          in 2013 has provided a fillip to bring in a new structure, a policy,
          create guidelines and frameworks, awareness and education, and
          provide opportunities for training and capacity building amongst the
          stakeholders, besides standards and certification.
